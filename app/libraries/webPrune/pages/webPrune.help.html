<h2 class="help"><strong>Editing</strong></h2>
<p>
Due to limitations in the browser it is not possible to show so many markers on 
the screen. Therefor you might need to zoom in to start editing.
</p>

<p>
Clicking a point will select that point and display information about it in 
the right panel. By pressing Shift and clicking a point will select a range. Information
regarding the range will also be displayed in the right panel.
</p>

<p>
After selecting a point, or range of points, you can edit/delete them. Right now the only
feature implemented is delete. More features will come.
</p>

<h2 class="help"><strong>Undo</strong></h2>
<p>
While editing all actions can be undone.
</p>

<h2 class="help"><strong>Compress</strong></h2>
<p>
When sharing a track with others it can be good to remove 
redundant points in the track. This can be done with the compress feature. Set the compression
rate (meters between points).
